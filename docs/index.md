The [Timeline Project](http://thetimelineproj.sourceforge.net/) application 
can be used to visualize the course of the narrative time in a 
[yWriter](http://spacejock.com/yWriter7.html) project.

## Features

- Generate a *yWriter* project from an outline created with *Timeline*.
- Generate a *Timeline* project from a *yWriter* project.
- Synchronize *yWriter* scenes with corresponding *Timeline* events in both directions.
- Synchronize *yWriter* items with corresponding special *Timeline* events in both directions.

 
## Requirements

- Windows.
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org). Python 3.4 or more recent will work. However, Python 3.7 or above is highly recommended.
- [yWriter 7](http://spacejock.com/yWriter7.html). Recent versions 5 or 6 might also work if they save in .yw7 file format.
- [Timeline 2.4](https://sourceforge.net/projects/thetimelineproj/). Versions below 2.4 do not support labels, which are necessary for synchronization with yWriter.

Generate a yWriter 7 project from an csv outline exported from Aeon Timeline 2. 

You can generate a yWriter project from a timeline outline, whereby date/time specifications are taken over, or also generate a timeline from a yWriter project the other way around. Afterwards, the whole thing can be synchronized, so that you can manage the date/time information of the scenes in Timeline. 
 
## Requirements

- Windows.
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org). Python 3.4 or more recent will work. However, Python 3.7 or above is highly recommended.
- [yWriter](http://spacejock.com/yWriter7.html).
- [Timeline](http://thetimelineproj.sourceforge.net/).
